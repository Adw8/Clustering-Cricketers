# IPL Player Performance Clustering Project

## Overview

This project centers around the transformation of raw IPL ball-by-ball data into player-level statistics. Additionally, it involves the application of three popular clustering algorithms—K-means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering—to discern patterns in player performances.

## Objectives

1. **Data Transformation:**
   - Convert detailed ball-by-ball records into comprehensive player-level statistics.

2. **Clustering Algorithms:**
   - Understand the fundamentals of three widely used clustering algorithms—K-means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN clustering.

3. **Application of Algorithms:**
   - Apply the clustering algorithms on the players' data to unveil distinctive patterns in their performances.

4. **Identify Player Similarities:**
   - Group players based on the outcomes of clustering algorithms, identifying how similar players get grouped together.

## Project Outcomes

The project outcomes will provide in-depth player statistics and dynamic player clustering. This clustering aims to enhance strategic insights, benefiting teams, scouts, and enthusiasts by offering a nuanced understanding of player performances in the IPL.
